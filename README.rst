Data Journalism Reading List
============================

This is the reading list for data journalism and computational journalism classes at
`Jomec <https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/journalism-media-and-culture>`_ (Cardiff University) for undergraduate and postgraduate journalism students. Some references have a link to the Cardiff University library that is only available to registered students but most of the works are online and the others are generally available from book dealers.
